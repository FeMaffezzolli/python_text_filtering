# Text Filtering

A very simple example of dealing with text input.
<br><br><br>
This code is concerned about importing a text (.txt) file, breaking the text into words inside a list, and then creating a new list by excluding certain words.
<br><br>
After that we use the 'Counter' library to count the most commom words in our list.
